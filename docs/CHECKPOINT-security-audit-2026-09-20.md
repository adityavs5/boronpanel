# Security audit execution checkpoint — 2026-09-20

Worktree: `/root/boronpanel-security-audit`, branch
`security-audit-2026-09-20`, based on
`231400957bb2989ee816801375176d9ac1e293cb`. The original checkout is
left untouched. Production remains `/opt/boron-1.5.0` via `/opt/boron`;
source fixes have not yet been released. Protected evidence, original
configuration, SQLite snapshot, original FTPS certificate, and the release
signing private key are under `/root/boron-security-audit/2026-09-20/`, not
Git. The private key has no confirmed off-host recovery copy.

Completed live changes: FTPS now presents the trusted panel certificate and
passes hostname validation; 10 pre-existing wildcard MariaDB grants were
replaced with exact grants. A disposable MariaDB user and two temporary
databases reproduced broad access before the fix and demonstrated owned
access plus cross-database denial afterward. All disposable resources from
that test were removed. A read-only post-check reports 0 legacy grants from
11 hosted database grants. Original grants are recorded in protected
`baseline/database-grants-before.jsonl`.

Source changes in progress: terminal and FileBrowser Origin checks; SVG
allowlist; mandatory verified and IP-pinned IMAP transport; scoped SQL dump
import; exact database grant creation and upgrade repair; transactional
Sieve updates; signed release/updater verification; FTPS certificate renewal
and update hooks. Focused tests passed: IMAP 21; updater/Sieve/grants/IMAP
combined 111; earlier TLS/updater 76; targeted branding upload 20; terminal
8; FileBrowser 2. `shellcheck`, `bash -n`, Python compilation and
`git diff --check` passed. The full suite, frontend build, browser checks,
release dry-run, and artifact acceptance have not yet been run.

Important pending work, in risk order:

1. Design and implement a meaningful root-daemon authorization boundary.
   The daemon currently authenticates the API Unix UID but trusts API-side
   authorization and client-supplied audit identity for all operations.
   API-held signing keys or rechecking a forged role are insufficient.
2. Complete per-route/per-RPC resource and role review and async job
   continuation checks; the 842 inventory rows remain pending individual
   disposition. Add scheduled/helper/listener inventory and ASVS/WSTG map.
3. Build an isolated full-system Ubuntu test environment. This sandbox
   denies namespaces, service sockets and systemd, so host isolation and
   real TLS/mail/installer/upgrade tests cannot be claimed here.
4. Complete hostile archive/restore/WordPress/Cloudflare/host review and
   legacy deferred fixes (quota enforcement, Redis socket squatting,
   updater artifact file race). Continue negative and positive tests.
5. Finish the signed-update trust bootstrap from the deployed unsigned
   updater, protected off-host signing-key recovery, current dependency
   advisory review, release gate, fresh install, upgrade, rollback and
   deployed acceptance. Do not publish or self-update before this is safe.

The work remains an active audit. There is no security release tag or GitHub
push from this worktree yet. Do not describe any source-only fix as deployed.
